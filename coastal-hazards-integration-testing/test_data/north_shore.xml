			<abstract>Due to continued coastal population growth and increased threats of erosion, current data on trends and rates of shoreline movement are required to inform shoreline and floodplain management. The Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management launched the Shoreline Change Project in 1989 to identify erosion-prone areas of the coast. In 2001, a 1994 shoreline was added to calculate both long- and short-term shoreline change rates at 40-meter intervals along ocean-facing sections of the Massachusetts coast. 

The Coastal and Marine Geology Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management, has compiled reliable historical shoreline data along open-facing sections of the Massachusetts coast under the Massachusetts Shoreline Change Mapping and Analysis Project 2013 Update. Two oceanfront shorelines for Massachusetts (approximately 1,800 km) were (1) delineated using 2008/09 color aerial orthoimagery, and (2) extracted from topographic LIDAR datasets (2007) obtained from NOAA's Ocean Service, Coastal Services Center. The new shorelines were integrated with existing Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (MA CZM) and USGS historical shoreline data in order to compute long- and short-term rates using the latest version of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS).</abstract>
			<purpose>This dataset includes shorelines from 157 years ranging from 1851 to 2008 within the North Shore A coastal region from North Salisbury at the New Hampshire border to the Annisquam River in Gloucester. Shorelines were compiled from T-sheets and air-photos obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (MA CZM), and lidar obtained from the US Geological Survey (USGS). Historical shoreline positions serve as easily understood features that can be used to describe the movement of beaches through time. These data are used to calculate rates of shoreline change for the MA CZM Shoreline Change Project. Rates of long-term and short-term shoreline change were generated in a GIS using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.3. DSAS uses a measurement baseline method to calculate rate-of-change statistics. Transects are cast from the reference baseline to intersect each shoreline, establishing measurement points used to calculate shoreline change rates. For publication purposes, the shoreline data for Massachusetts were organized by region in order match the extent of previously published uncertainty files used in shoreline change calculations.</purpose>

			<attraccr>The data provided here are a compilation of shorelines from multiple sources, spanning 157 years. The attributes are based on the requirements of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software and have gone through a series of quality assurance procedures.</attraccr>
		</attracc>
		<logic>Adjacent shoreline segments do not overlap and are not necessarily continuous. Shorelines were quality checked for accuracy. Any slight offsets between adjacent segments due to georeferencing and digitizing error are taken into account in the uncertainty calculations included in the corresponding report (U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2012-1189). These data contain some short line segments (less than 30 meters) that were part of how the data were originally compiled and are in fact continuous with other segments of a given shoreline.</logic>
		<complete>This shoreline file is complete and contains all shoreline segments used to calculate shoreline change rates along sections of the North Shore A coastal region where shoreline position data were available. These data adequately represented the shoreline position at the time of the survey. Remaining gaps in these data, if applicable, are a consequence of non-existing data or existing data that did not meet quality assurance standards.</complete>
		<posacc>
			<horizpa>
				<horizpar>Shoreline data have been acquired from 1857 to 2008, the horizontal accuracy of which varies with respect to data source from which the shorelines were digitized, the lidar data from which the shorelines were extracted, and the time period. Shorelines prior to 1959 have an estimated positional uncertainty of plus or minus 10.8 meters. Air photo-derived shorelines from 1960-1994 have an estimated positional uncertainty of plus or minus 5.1 meters. Shorelines derived from 15cm 2008 orthophotos have an estimated positional uncertainty of plus or minus 1.0 meters. Shorelines derived from 30cm 2008 orthophotos have an estimated positional uncertainty of plus or minus 2.3 meters. The lidar shorelines from 2000 have an estimated positional uncertainty of plus or minus 1.3 meters. Please visit the Estimation of Shoreline Position Uncertainty section in the corresponding USGS Open-File Report (http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2012/1189/) for a complete explanation of the measurement uncertainties associated with these shorelines.</horizpar>
			</horizpa>
			<vertacc>
				<vertaccr>The historic shorelines are proxy-based and estimate the HWL. The lidar shoreline is tidal-based and estimates MHW. While the proxy-based HWL shorelines are not shifted to the MHW datum, the distance measurements established by the transects and used by DSAS to compute rate-of-change statistics are adjusted to account for the unidirectional offset between HWL and MHW. Therefore, all distance measurements along DSAS transects in this region are referenced to the MHW datum before rates are calculated.</vertaccr>

				<srccontr>Full-color, digital orthophotographs were provided by MCZM on CD-ROM. The photos have a resolution of 1 meter per pixel. The aerial photography was flown in September/October 94 by the National Ocean Service (NOS photographic missions 94061, 94062, 94063, and 94064) at a nominal scale of 1:48,000. The photographs were scanned and orthorectified by EarthData International (Gaithersburg, MD) using camera station information supplied to EarthData by NOS. The CD-ROMs supplied by MCZM contained mosaicked orthophotos at 1-meter/pixel resolution, with boundaries corresponding to the existing MCZM shoreline change maps, as well as ArcInfo TIF World File (TFW) georeferencing information.</srccontr>

				<procdesc>Shoreline data were sought in an effort to compile as many quality shorelines as possible for the region. Digital shorelines were acquired from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Massachusetts office of Coastal Zone Management (MA CZM). Historic shoreline positions obtained from USGS were projected in Esri's ArcToolbox (v.9.3)&gt;Data Management Tools&gt;Projections and Transformations&gt;Feature&gt;Project. Parameters: input projection = Geographic Coordinate System (WGS 1984); output projection = State Plane Massachusetts Mainland FIPS 2001 (NAD83); transformation = NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_5. 

All MA CZM shoreline data for the North Shore A region were appended to the USGS NewEnglandN_shorelines shapefile in ArcToolbox &gt;Data Management Tools&gt;General&gt;Append and was renamed NorthShoreA_shorelines. The appended shoreline dataset was coded with the following attribute fields: ID, Route ID, Source, Date, Uncertainty (Uncy), Shape Length (Shape_Leng), Year, and Original ID.

This process step and all subsequent process steps were performed by the same person - Theresa Smith.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>Vector high water line (HWL) 2008 shorelines were digitized from 15 cm and 30 cm resolution, 4-band (RGB natural and IR) color orthophotographs using the sketch tool in ArcEditor/ArcMap v9.3. The shorelines were digitized at a scale of 1:300 for the 15 cm and 1:500 for the 30 cm orthophotos. The shorelines were delineated using the following indicators as proxies for the high water line, after Thieler and others (2001) and Boak and Turner (2005): 1) the previous high tide line seaward of the storm debris wrack line, as indicated by the tonal changes between wet and dry beach material (i.e., sand, gravel, cobble), a seaweed or debris line or a combination of both; 2) the high-tide wrack line, created when the high tide deposits seaweed and debris on the upper beach; 3) the vegetation change between Spartina patens in the upper marsh and Spartina alterniflora in the lower marsh, or the outer limits of emergent marsh vegetation (when vegetation types were not discernible); 4) the algal line on rocky outcrops, indicated by the tonal change between wet surfaces that host algae and dry surfaces with no algae; 5) the maximum wave runup limit at or near high tide indicated by the interface between the land and water; and 6) the interface between vertical seawalls/bulkheads and open water.

				<attrlabl>Uncy</attrlabl>
				<attrdef>Estimate of shoreline position uncertainty. Actual shoreline position is within the range of this value (plus or minus, meters). Actual shoreline position is within the range of this value (plus or minus, meters). The method used to determine this uncertainty is described in the accompanying written report (Open-File Report 2012-1189) under the section titled "Estimation of Shoreline Position Uncertainty" (http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2012/1189). The historic shoreline uncertainty values contain all of the measurement errors listed in Table 2 of OFR 2012-1189, except for the uncertainty of the High Water Line (HWL). The HWL uncertainty listed in Table 2 was averaged for the entire state (4.3). However, the uncertainty of the HWL at an individual transect can be determined with more precision along the shoreline route. The HWL uncertainty was added to the historic shoreline uncertainty stored in the shoreline attribute table during the DSAS rate calculation process to better account for uncertainty at individual transects alongshore as opposed to using a regionally averaged value. This was done using linear referencing that interpolates a value based on data stored in the shoreline_uncertainty dBase file (.dbf) at a specific transect/shoreline intersect alongshore. The lidar shoreline position uncertainty is also stored in the associated shoreline_uncertainty.dbf file and values are interpolated at specific transect/shoreline intersections using the same linear referencing method. The lidar uncertainty attribute field was filled with null values while residing in the geodatabase. Upon exporting the shoreline feature class to a shapefile for publication, the null values in the lidar uncertainty field were automatically converted to zero values.</attrdef>
